krom:              Thank you for your indisposable clean-room, micro-test
                   ROMs. These, especially the RSP vector ROMs, have saved me
                   hours of hair-pulling. And, with my impatience, there's no
                   way I would have ever come close to developing something so
                   intricate.

Iconoclast:        Although we hardly ever see eye-to-eye with regards to
                   development practices, your zilmar-spec RSP plugin was
                   instrumental to getting CEN64 to the point where it is
                   today. Without a basis of comparison, the initial SSE-
                   ification of the RSP algorithms would have been even more
                   testing than it already was.

mikeryan:          For single-handedly implementing virtually all of the save-
                   related bits and pieces, fixing hard-to-catch PIF bugs, your
                   work on the SM5, OSX fixes, advice on locking down cen64.com,
                   and all the other help you've provided. Consider this message
                   to be an effective coupon for a beer on me!

OzOnE/LuigiBlood   For your fantastic documentation and efforts on reversing
                   the 64DD. Without your efforts, there's no way that CEN64
                   would have 64DD support.

izy:               For all your optimization work - from the VR4300 to RSP,
                   audio, and beyond! CEN64's performance on x86 has improved
                   due to your work!

jrra:              For your work on MBC3/transfer pak and the various other
                   things you've done to help the project!

simer:             Thanks for your work on the cart database! (whether it be
Snowstorm64:       populating entries, shifting from the use of cart title to
                   cart ID, or adding additional save types)

AIO:               Thank you for your RSP/SSE optimizations. It's always nice
                   to see someone else's approaches to vectorizing some of the
                   RSP instructions!

#n64dev:           Thank you to everyone else that's helped out in the past:
                   marshallh, mikeryan, balrog, and anyone else that I'm
                   forgetting.
